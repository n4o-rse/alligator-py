# ALLIGATOR-PY NOTE, not part of the upstream file: this is a verbatim copy of
# leiza-scit/CAA2026-alligator/py/wd_repro.py, salt included, so that the same
# figure built here and there comes out with the same element ids. Everything
# below this line is upstream's; edits belong there first. The openpyxl half is
# inert here -- this repository writes no spreadsheets -- and is kept only so
# the two copies can be diffed. Lint exemptions in pyproject.toml, same reason.
"""Make matplotlib output byte-reproducible. Import this; that is all.

Two things in a matplotlib figure change on every run even when the figure does
not: the creation timestamp written into the SVG metadata, and the ids of the
`<path>` elements defined for ticks and markers, which are hashes salted with a
random value. Between them they rewrite dozens of lines per file, so every
rebuild shows a diff on every figure.

That matters beyond tidiness. A file that always shows up as modified trains
everyone to skip its diff, and once nobody reads the diff, a real change to a
published figure passes unnoticed. Reproducible output means a diff appears
exactly when something actually changed - the only state in which a diff is
worth reading.

Usage - one line, anywhere among the imports:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import wd_repro            # noqa: F401  (imported for its effect)

No call, no ordering rule, and no change at the savefig call sites.

Why it is safe to do this on import
-----------------------------------
The obvious implementation - setting ``plt.rcParams["svg.hashsalt"]`` inside
each script - has a trap: ``plt.rcdefaults()`` resets it along with everything
else, and this family's convention is that every script calls ``rcdefaults()``
before applying its own styling. The salt would be silently discarded and the
ids random again, with nothing to show for it.

Changing ``matplotlib.rcParamsDefault`` instead means ``rcdefaults()`` restores
*this* value rather than a random one, so the setting survives the reset and the
order of the two no longer matters. Verified both ways round.

The date comes from the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable, which matplotlib
reads when it writes a file rather than when it is imported - which is why this
works from a module imported at any point, and why no savefig call has to change.

This module deliberately does NOT import matplotlib.pyplot or select a backend;
it touches one dictionary and one environment variable. Importing it from a
script that never draws anything costs nothing.
